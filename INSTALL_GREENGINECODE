REQUIREMENTS

(Sun/Open) Grid Engine is needed on every node and Wake On LAN too...
If some jobs are launch from another way, forget this tool.
Notice that if Wake on Lan is not detected by the master on some nodes,
it won't try to halt or boot these nodes...

INSTALL

1/ Download the scripts greenginecode.sh, boot_node.sh, cleanhalt.sh,
the service greenginecode and the greenginecode.conf file here :
http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/calcul_isem/isem-softwares/tools/

2/ Move greenginecode.sh, boot_node.sh and cleanhalt.sh to your /sbin
directory (or do symlinks).

3/ Transform all these scripts to be executable for root (chmod +x *.sh)

4/ Move the service file greenginecode to /etc/init.d/

5/ Move the configuration file greenginecode.conf in your /etc/ directory.

That's all !!


USAGE / CONFIGURATION

Configure greenginecode to suit to your own cluster with
/etc/greenginecode.conf file.


To use the service :

service greenginecode start
service greenginecode status
service greenginecode stop
service greenginecode restart


All the things are logged into /var/log/greenginecode.

queue.log is the general log for actions
service.log is a log file for the service.

Check these two files to solve problems if needed.

Some files to work onto queues (and WoL) are stored into
/var/lib/greenginecode directory
